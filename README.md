# Spherical World and Biome Generation

#### Hello, this is an attempt at making a prcedurally generated sphreical world. The code in this project are not meant to be refactored and concise, as i no longer work on this branch. So please be aware of the unconventional practices and spaghetti-ness in this project, you have been warned! I am now working on a better version of this project could potentionally develop it into an procedurally generated sandbox/survival-ish game.


Here is a screenshot of what the generated world look like.
